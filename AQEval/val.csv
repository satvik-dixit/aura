Idling is a common sound that is often heard when a vehicle's engine is not in use but is still running. The sound of the engine idling can vary depending on the type of engine and the conditions under which it is running. In general, the sound of an engine idling is typically described as a low, smooth buzzing sound. As the engine idles, the sound may gradually decrease in pitch as the engine's RPMs decrease. This is because the engine is not producing as much power and the sound waves are not traveling as fast through the engine's cylinders. Once the engine has been idling for a period of time, the sound may eventually cease altogether as the engine comes to a stop.",1.0

clotho_development,like a jet aircraft landing.wav,long,What is the sound of the airplane taking off and departing?,The airplane sound starts as it begins to take off and continues until it departs.,qwen_ac,"The sound of an airplane taking off and departing can vary depending on the type of aircraft, the runway, and the weather conditions. However, the general process of an airplane taking off and departing typically involves the following steps:    1. Engine start-up: The engines of the airplane are started and run up to the required power level.    2. Engine idle: The engines are idled to ensure that all systems are functioning properly and to allow the pilots to check the weather and other important information.    3. Takeoff roll: The airplane begins to move down the runway, accelerating gradually until it reaches the takeoff speed.    4. V1: At this point, the engines are switched from idle to full power, and the pilots begin to apply forward pressure to the yoke or stick to begin the climb.    5. V2: As the airplane reaches the velocity of 240 knots (273 miles per hour), the pilots apply full forward pressure to the yoke or stick and the engines continue to power up.    6. Climb: The airplane begins to climb, and the engines continue to provide power.    7. Cruise: Once the airplane has reached its cruising altitude, the engines continue to provide power, and the pilots maintain a steady course and altitude.    8. Descent: When the pilots want to descend, they gradually reduce the engines' power and begin to prepare for landing.    9. Touchdown: The airplane touches down on the runway, and the engines are shut down.    10. Parking: The airplane comes to a stop, and the engines are turned off. The pilots then begin the process of preparing for departure.    Overall, the sound of an airplane taking off and departing can be described as a loud, high-pitched engine noise that gradually increases in volume as the airplane accelerates down the runway and gains altitude.",1.0
